# Stop-and-Frisk Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project analyzes stop-and-frisk data from the New York Police Department (NYPD). It focuses on trends in stop-and-frisk incidents, particularly comparing the years before and after the implementation of the policy. The analysis includes examining racial and gender biases, arrest and frisk rates, crime patterns, and borough-based stop frequencies.

## Features

- **Data Parsing:** Reads and processes stop-and-frisk data from a CSV file.
- **Analysis:** 
  - Analyzes arrest and frisk rates by year.
  - Examines racial and gender biases in stop-and-frisk records.
  - Compares crime trends over multiple years.
  - Identifies which borough had the most stops.
- **Output:** Provides statistical insights into patterns of racial, gender, and geographical disparities in stop-and-frisk practices.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have the necessary CSV data file (e.g., `stop-and-frisk-data.csv`).
3. Compile and run the program using your preferred Java environment.

## Usage

- The program will read from the CSV file, analyze the data, and provide insights into various stop-and-frisk trends.
- You can modify the code to analyze specific years, races, or crime types as needed.
